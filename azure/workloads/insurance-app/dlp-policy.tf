# Data Loss Prevention (DLP) — connector governance.
#
# CAF / Power Platform guidance: classify the connector catalog into
# Business / Non-Business / Blocked, default unknown connectors to a safe group,
# block risky connectors, and restrict custom connectors. We ship two policies:
#   * a tenant-wide BASELINE that blocks the worst connectors everywhere;
#   * an ENVIRONMENT-SCOPED policy for the insurance environments that puts the
#     widest set of certified connectors in Business and pins custom connectors
#     to the APIM gateway host.
# Connector lists live in variables.tf -> adaptive: change the posture there.
